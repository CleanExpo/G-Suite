# Content Integrity & Verification Framework
# CRITICAL: These rules are non-negotiable for ALL copy

version: "1.0"
priority: "HIGHEST"
principle: "Every word must be original, every claim must be verifiable"

core_mandates:
  uniqueness:
    requirement: "100% original content"
    definition: "No copied phrases, sentences, or structures from any source"
    applies_to:
      - "Headlines and subheads"
      - "Body copy"
      - "CTAs"
      - "Meta descriptions"
      - "Alt text"
      - "All customer-facing text"

  non_plagiarism:
    requirement: "Zero tolerance for plagiarism"
    includes:
      - "Direct copying (obvious)"
      - "Paraphrasing too closely"
      - "Structural copying (same flow/logic)"
      - "Template copy from competitors"
      - "Generic industry phrases presented as original"

  verifiability:
    requirement: "100% verifiable claims"
    rule: "If you can't prove it, don't say it"
    applies_to:
      - "Statistics and numbers"
      - "Experience claims"
      - "Qualifications"
      - "Awards and recognition"
      - "Customer results"
      - "Comparative claims"

verification_framework:
  claim_categories:
    tier_1_must_verify:
      examples:
        - "Licensed with QBCC #12345"
        - "Serving Brisbane since 2010"
        - "Over 500 5-star reviews"
        - "Response within 2 hours"
      verification:
        - "License: Link to official registry lookup"
        - "Years: Business registration date"
        - "Reviews: Current count on platform"
        - "Response: Actual measured data"

    tier_2_should_verify:
      examples:
        - "Family-owned business"
        - "Locally operated"
        - "Fully insured"
        - "Trained technicians"
      verification:
        - "Ownership: Business structure"
        - "Local: Address verification"
        - "Insurance: Policy confirmation"
        - "Training: Certificates held"

    tier_3_avoid_unless_proven:
      examples:
        - "Best in Brisbane"
        - "Cheapest prices"
        - "Fastest service"
        - "Most experienced"
      rule: "Superlatives require proof or must be removed"
      alternative: "Use specific, verifiable claims instead"

claim_transformation:
  unverifiable_to_verifiable:
    - before: "We're the best plumbers in Brisbane"
      problem: "Unverifiable superlative"
      after: "Licensed plumbers with 200+ 5-star Google reviews"
      why: "Specific, countable, checkable"

    - before: "Fast response times"
      problem: "Vague, unmeasurable"
      after: "Same-day service, typically within 2 hours"
      why: "Specific timeframe, verifiable pattern"

    - before: "Affordable prices"
      problem: "Subjective, unverifiable"
      after: "Upfront pricing before work begins"
      why: "Process claim, verifiable"

    - before: "Quality workmanship"
      problem: "Vague, subjective"
      after: "All work backed by 12-month warranty"
      why: "Specific commitment, verifiable"

    - before: "Trusted by thousands"
      problem: "Vague number, unverifiable"
      after: "Trusted by 2,500+ Brisbane homeowners since 2010"
      why: "Specific number and timeframe"

research_to_original_content:
  principle: "Research informs, never replaces"

  process:
    step_1:
      action: "Collect customer language (quotes, reviews, forums)"
      purpose: "Understand how customers express problems"

    step_2:
      action: "Identify patterns and themes"
      purpose: "Find common pain points and desires"

    step_3:
      action: "Synthesize into original expression"
      purpose: "Create new language that captures essence"
      rule: "NEVER copy customer quotes directly into copy"

    step_4:
      action: "Weave naturally into original structure"
      purpose: "Customer language inspires, doesn't replace writing"

  example:
    research_found: |
      Customer review: "Finally found someone who actually shows up when they say they will. So tired of waiting around all day for tradies who never come."

    wrong_approach: |
      "We show up when we say we will. You won't wait around all day."
      (Too close to original)

    correct_approach: |
      "We give you a 2-hour arrival window - and we stick to it. Your time matters."
      (Original expression of same pain point)
