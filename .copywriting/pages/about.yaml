          "After 15 years working for other plumbing companies,
          I got tired of seeing customers treated like interruptions.
          Calls not returned. Appointments missed. Quotes that doubled.

          So in 2008, I started [Company] with one simple idea:
          treat every customer the way I'd want my mum treated.

          That means actually answering the phone. Showing up on time.
          Explaining what's wrong before we fix it. And charging fairly.

          It's not complicated. It's just how things should work."
