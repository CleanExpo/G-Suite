# Research-Driven Copywriting Framework

Write website copy that converts using real customer language.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Research audience
cp _templates/audience-research.template.yaml research/my-audience.yaml
# Edit with real quotes from forums, reviews, social media

# 2. Analyze competitors
cp _templates/competitor-analysis.template.yaml competitor/competitor-1.yaml
# Document page structures of top competitors

# 3. Generate copy
cp _templates/page-copy.template.yaml pages/my-homepage.yaml
# Write copy using research data
```

## The 3-Phase System

| Phase | Focus | Time | Output |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Audience Research | 2-4 hours | VOC quotes database |
| 2 | Competitor Analysis | 2-3 hours | Page structure patterns |
| 3 | Copy Generation | 1-2 hours/page | Conversion copy |

## Core Principle

**Real customer words > Marketing speak**

- Use THEIR exact words for pain points
- Use THEIR language for benefits
- Use THEIR objections for FAQs
- Never summarize or interpret - quote directly

## Voice of Customer Categories

| Category | What to Find | Gold Signal |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pain Points | Problems, frustrations | 3+ same complaint |
| Symptoms | Daily manifestations | Vivid, emotional |
| Dream Outcomes | What they really want | Aspirational |
| Failed Solutions | What didn't work | Specific products/services |
| Buying Decisions | How they choose | Trust triggers |

## Where to Research

- Reddit subreddits (raw frustrations)
- Google/Yelp reviews (decision language)
- Facebook groups (casual complaints)
- Industry forums (technical issues)
- Competitor reviews (what's missing)

## Copy Rules

### DO
- Use customer's exact words
- Write like talking to a friend
- Short sentences, short paragraphs
- One idea per paragraph
- Verified claims only

### DON'T
- Industry jargon
- Corporate phrasing
- Clichés (solutions, leverage, synergy)
- Made-up statistics
- AI-sounding language
- Exclamation points overuse

## Page Structure

1. **Hero** - Dream outcome headline, pain point subhead
2. **Problem** - Show you understand (their words)
3. **Value Props** - 3-5 benefits with "because"
4. **Social Proof** - Video testimonials > Written
5. **Process** - 3-5 simple steps (their experience)
6. **FAQ** - Real objections from research
7. **CTA** - Clear next action

## Pattern Detection

- **3+ mentions** = Use in headlines
- **5+ mentions** = Core messaging pillar
- **Emotional adjectives** = Voice/tone guide
- **Specific numbers** = Use in copy
