    description: "AI aggregates data from multiple sources to build entity graphs"
    sources_used:
      - "Google Knowledge Graph"
      - "Bing Entity Index"
      - "Wikipedia/Wikidata"
      - "Business directories"
      - "Website structured data"
      - "Social profiles"

  consolidation_signals:
    strong:
      - "Exact name match across sources"
      - "Identical address format"
      - "Same phone number"
      - "sameAs schema links"
      - "Consistent ABN/ACN"

    moderate:
      - "Similar name variations"
      - "Same suburb/postcode"
      - "Matching categories"

    weak:
      - "Similar descriptions"
      - "Overlapping service areas"

entity_splitting_causes:
  description: "When AI sees different entity instead of same business"
  causes:
    - cause: "Name variations"
      example: "Smith Plumbing vs Smith Plumbing Pty Ltd vs Smiths Plumbing"
      impact: "Three separate entities created"

    - cause: "Address inconsistencies"
      example: "1/23 Main St vs Unit 1, 23 Main Street"
      impact: "AI unsure if same location"

    - cause: "Multiple phone numbers"
      example: "Different number on website vs GBP"
      impact: "Lower confidence in data accuracy"

    - cause: "Missing sameAs links"
      example: "No schema connecting website to social profiles"
      impact: "Profiles not associated"

sameas_implementation:
  purpose: "Explicitly tell AI which profiles belong to same entity"
