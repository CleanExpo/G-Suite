## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Initialize Components

```python
from src.agents.orchestrator import OrchestratorAgent

# Initialize orchestrator (loads all components)
orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent()

# Components automatically initialized:
# - Agent registry
# - Independent verifier
# - Tool registry with MCP
# - Subagent manager
```

### 2. Execute Simple Task

```python
# Orchestrator handles routing, execution, verification
result = await orchestrator.run(
    task_description="Add health check endpoint",
    context={}
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Route to backend agent
# 2. Execute with self-correction (up to 3 attempts)
# 3. Submit for independent verification
# 4. Return result with evidence
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Task

```python
from src.agents.subagent_manager import SubTask

# Define parallel subtasks
subtasks = [
    SubTask(
        subtask_id="ui",
        description="Create login UI",
        agent_type="frontend"
    ),
    SubTask(
        subtask_id="api",
        description="Create auth API",
        agent_type="backend"
    ),
    SubTask(
        subtask_id="tests",
        description="Write E2E tests",
        agent_type="test",
        dependencies=["ui", "api"]  # Runs after others
    )
]

# Execute with coordination
results = await orchestrator.coordinate_parallel(subtasks)

# Frontend and backend run in parallel
# Tests run after both complete
```

### 4. Session Learning

```python
from src.memory.session_manager import SessionManager

session_manager = SessionManager()
session = await session_manager.start_session(task_type="feature")

# ... agents work ...

summary = await session_manager.end_session(
    session_id=session.session_id,
    task_outcomes=outcomes
)

# Learnings automatically stored:
# - Successful patterns
# - Failure patterns to avoid
# - Accumulated knowledge
```
