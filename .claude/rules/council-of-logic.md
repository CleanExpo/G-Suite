# Council of Logic - Mathematical First Principles

> **System Mode**: MATHEMATICAL_FIRST_PRINCIPLES
> **Authority Level**: Orchestrator Override

## The Council

Four legendary minds govern all technical decisions. Their principles are non-negotiable.

### Alan Turing - Algorithmic Efficiency & Logic

**Focus**: Reduce code complexity. Demand optimal time complexity.

**Rules**:

- O(n²) algorithms are **REJECTED** - demand O(n) or O(log n)
- Every loop must justify its existence
- Recursive solutions must prove termination
- State machines must be deterministic and minimal

**Before Code**:

```
Turing Check: What is the time complexity?
- If O(n²) or worse → REFACTOR
- If O(n log n) → ACCEPTABLE
- If O(n) or O(log n) → APPROVED
```

### John von Neumann - System Architecture & Game Theory

**Focus**: Optimize agent workflows. Treat interactions as strategic games.

**Rules**:

- Every user interaction is a game theory move
- Maximise conversion through optimal strategy
- System architecture must support parallel execution
- Memory hierarchy: hot path = cache, cold path = lazy load

**Before Architecture**:

```
Von Neumann Check: Is this the Nash Equilibrium?
- User benefit maximised? ✓
- System cost minimised? ✓
- Competing concerns balanced? ✓
```

### Pierre Bézier - Frontend Physics & Animation

**Focus**: Interpolation curves for luxury UI. No linear transitions.

**Rules**:

- **BANNED**: `transition: all 0.3s linear`
- **REQUIRED**: Physics-based springs, cubic-bezier curves
- Every animation must feel "weighted" and "intentional"
- Micro-interactions on every state change

**Approved Easings**:

```css
/* Spring - bouncy, playful */
--ease-spring: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);

/* Smooth - elegant, refined */
--ease-smooth: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);

/* Bounce - energetic, celebration */
--ease-bounce: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);

/* Out-Expo - snappy, decisive */
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1);
```

**Before Animation**:

```
Bézier Check: Does this feel "expensive"?
- Linear timing? → REJECT
- Abrupt start/stop? → REJECT
- Physics-based curve? → APPROVED
```

### Claude Shannon - Information Theory (Token Economy)

**Focus**: Maximum signal, minimum noise. Compress everything.

**Rules**:

- Every prompt must be entropy-optimised
- Data structures compressed to essential bits
- Redundant information is wasted tokens
- API responses: return exactly what's needed, nothing more

**Before Communication**:

```
Shannon Check: What is the signal-to-noise ratio?
- Redundant words? → COMPRESS
- Unnecessary fields? → REMOVE
- Implicit > Explicit when context allows
```

## Workflow Override Protocol

### STEP 1: THE PROOF

Before writing ANY code, state the mathematical/logical model:

```markdown
## Mathematical Model

**Problem**: [State the problem in formal terms]

**Turing**: Time complexity target = O(?)
**Von Neumann**: Architecture pattern = [pattern]
**Bézier**: Animation curve = [easing function]
**Shannon**: Data compression = [strategy]
```

### STEP 2: THE SOLVE

Execute with council approval:

```markdown
## Implementation

**Turing Approval**: [complexity analysis]
**Von Neumann Approval**: [architecture justification]
**Bézier Approval**: [animation specification]
**Shannon Approval**: [compression verification]
```

### STEP 3: THE VERIFY

Post-implementation council review:

```markdown
## Council Review

- [ ] Turing: No O(n²) or worse
- [ ] Von Neumann: Nash equilibrium achieved
- [ ] Bézier: All transitions physics-based
- [ ] Shannon: Maximum compression applied
```

## Quick Reference: Council Objections

| Council Member | Red Flag                               | Resolution                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Turing         | Nested loops, .filter().map().filter() | Single-pass algorithm      |
| Von Neumann    | Blocking operations, race conditions   | Async/parallel design      |
| Bézier         | Linear timing, jarring transitions     | Spring/bezier curves       |
| Shannon        | Verbose prompts, bloated payloads      | Compress, dedupe, minimise |

## Integration with Orchestrator

The Council of Logic operates as a **pre-flight check** for all agent outputs:

```python
class CouncilOfLogic:
    def validate(self, output: AgentOutput) -> CouncilVerdict:
        verdicts = [
            self.turing.check_complexity(output.code),
            self.von_neumann.check_architecture(output.design),
            self.bezier.check_animations(output.ui),
            self.shannon.check_compression(output.data),
        ]
        return CouncilVerdict(
            approved=all(v.passed for v in verdicts),
            objections=[v for v in verdicts if not v.passed],
        )
```
