# Research-Driven Copywriting Framework

Voice of Customer system: Real words > AI-generated. UNIQUE > Template.

## INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS (Non-negotiable)

| Requirement | Rule | Consequence |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Uniqueness | 100% original content | Full rewrite if copied |
| Plagiarism | Zero tolerance | Immediate removal |
| Verifiability | Every claim provable | Evidence required |

**Before publish:** Plagiarism check PASSED, evidence documented, stake reputation on every word.

## 3-Phase System

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1. Research | Find customer language | Pain points, symptoms, dreams, failures |
| 2. Competitor | Learn proven structures | Page sections, order, features |
| 3. Generate | Create with customer voice | Conversion-focused copy |

## Voice of Customer Categories

| Category | Find | Gold Pattern |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Pain Points | Current frustrations | 3+ mentions = GOLD |
| Symptoms | How problem manifests | Specific situations |
| Dream Outcomes | Ideal result | Emotional + practical |
| Failed Solutions | What didn't work | "I tried X but..." |
| Buying Decisions | Why they chose | Trust triggers |

## Research Sources

1. Message boards (Reddit, local groups)
2. Review sites (yours + competitors)
3. Industry forums
4. Customer interviews
5. Support tickets/emails

**Rule:** Extract EXACT words, not summaries. Transform into original copy.

## Conversion Structure

| Section | Purpose | Formula |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hero | Grab attention | Headline + Subhead + CTA |
| Problem | Validate pain | Symptom → Cost → Urgency |
| Value Props | Why you | Benefit + Because + Proof |
| Social Proof | Build trust | Quote + Name + Context |
| Process | Remove fear | Steps + Timeline + Outcome |
| FAQ | Handle objections | Question + Direct answer |
| CTA | Drive action | What + Why + How |

## Copy Rules

| DO | DON'T |
|-----|-------|
| Use "you" and "your" | Use "we" and "our" |
| Specific numbers | Vague claims ("many") |
| Benefits + because | Features alone |
| Conversational tone | Corporate speak |
| Active voice | Passive voice |
| Short sentences (15-20 words) | Long complex sentences |

## Banned Words

```
leverage, synergy, optimize, cutting-edge, best-in-class,
world-class, industry-leading, innovative, revolutionary, utilize
```

## Evidence Requirements

| Claim Type | Evidence Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| License/Certification | Registry lookup link |
| Years in business | Registration date |
| Review count/rating | Platform link + screenshot + date |
| Response time | Internal policy/data |
| Warranty | Written terms document |

## Claim Transformation

| Unverifiable | Verifiable |
|--------------|------------|
| "Best plumber in Brisbane" | "200+ 5-star Google reviews" |
| "Fast response" | "Same-day service, within 2 hours" |
| "Affordable prices" | "Upfront pricing before work begins" |
| "Quality work" | "All work backed by 12-month warranty" |

## Pre-Publish Gate

```
[ ] Plagiarism check PASSED
[ ] All claims have documented evidence
[ ] Would stake reputation on every word
[ ] Customer language INSPIRED (not copied)
[ ] Structure is original
```
