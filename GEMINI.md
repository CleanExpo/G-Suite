# G-Pilot Engine: Core Protocols

## 🚀 Mission Statement
To provide an autonomous AI orchestration layer for elite founders, leveraging Google Cloud's most advanced reasoning models (Gemini Pro, VEO, Imagen) in a secure, military-grade environment.

## 🛡️ Operational Directives
1. **Autonomous Execution**: "Green Light" mode is the standard. Proceed from research to implementation silently.
2. **Visual Authority**: Maintain the **v8.1-Refined Standard**. 3D Glass Medallions, 8K Cinematic Imagery, and Linear-Style Minimalist UI are non-negotiable.
3. **Sovereign Security**: Ensure all client secrets remain in the **Vault**. Logic is ephemeral; security is absolute.
4. **Recursive Efficiency**: Leverage local skills and dynamic skill generation to maintain a self-evolving core.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack (The Vanguard)
- **Engine**: Next.js 16 (Turbopack)
- **Reasoning**: LangChain + LangGraph (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run + Firebase Admin
- **Identity**: Clerk (Dark Mode Native)
- **Ledger**: Stripe + BullMQ Transactional Hooks
